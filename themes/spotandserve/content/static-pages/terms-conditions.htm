They're simple, easy to understand, and sprinkled with a touch of entertainment. By using our service, you agree to these terms.</p>

<h2>1. Eligibility</h2>

<p>To use SpotAndServe, you must be at least 13 years old. If you're under 13, you'll have to wait a bit longer to join our community of helpers and requesters.</p>

<h2>2. Accounts</h2>

<p>You can explore SpotAndServe without an account, but some features might be hiding behind the curtain. To access our full range of services, consider creating an account.</p>

<h2>3. Conduct</h2>

<p>We expect all users to play nice in our digital sandbox. That means:</p>

<ul>
	<li>No illegal content or behavior</li>
	<li>No abusive language or actions</li>
	<li>Just good ol' fashioned common sense</li>
</ul>

<p>Remember, you're part of a community, so please be respectful and professional.</p>

<h2>4. Violations</h2>

<p>If you break the rules, we may have to take action. This could include:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Temporary suspensions</li>
	<li>Permanent bans</li>
	<li>Deletion of content</li>
	<li>Reporting to law enforcement if required</li>
</ul>

<p>We hope we never have to go down this path, but it's important to keep SpotAndServe safe and enjoyable for everyone.</p>

<h2>5. Liability</h2>

<p>We provide SpotAndServe as-is, and we don't accept any liability for your use of our service. In other words, if something goes wrong, we're sorry, but we can't be held responsible.</p>

<h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>

<p>You own the content you submit, but by using SpotAndServe, you grant us a license to use that content as needed to provide our services. It's a win-win situation!</p>

<h2>7. Termination</h2>

<p>If you want to say goodbye to SpotAndServe, just send an email to <a href=\"mailto:contact@spotandserve.ca\">contact@spotandserve.ca</a>, and we'll help you with the process. We'll be sad to see you go, but we respect your decision.</p>

<h2>8. Disputes and Governing Law</h2>

<p>Any disputes that might arise from your use of SpotAndServe will be governed by the laws of Canada. We hope we never have to go to court, but if we do, we'll put on our fanciest suits and resolve the matter professionally.</p>

<p>That's it! You've reached the end of our Terms &amp; Conditions. Now go out there and make the world a better place with SpotAndServe. And remember, always be kind to one another!</p>"
